# SiteswapJS Twitch integration
### Setup
Change the login credentials for your bot in `botlogin.js`. Generate oauth here: https://twitchapps.com/tmi/
Add `twitch.html` as a browser source in OBS.
If hosting this online, make sure to protect the directory to not reveal your bots login credentials.
### Usage
`!ss <siteswap>` 

It will automatically update the prop to the emotes seen in chat.

Examples: 

`!ss 5` (Juggles a 5 ball cascade)
  
`!ss 441` (Juggles a cool 3 ball pattern called 441)
  
`!ss 97531` (This is a beast of a trick, one of my favorites!)
  
### To do
  * Support BTTV and FrankerFaceZ emotes
  * Add support for Youtube live chat
